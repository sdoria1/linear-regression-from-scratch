# Project:
This project implements linear regression using only NumPy, with no external ML libraries. It demonstrates the mechanics of model fitting, prediction, and evaluation at a low level.

# Project Purpose:
This project was developed as part of a structured ML fundamentals program, to build intuition for linear regression by coding it from first principles.

# Implementation Details:
TBD

# How to work with this repo:
TBD

# Observations:
